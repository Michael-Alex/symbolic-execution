For more information see 

llvm-2.6 contains the update to LLVM, mainly the "CallPaths" LLVM analysis pass.
This uses Boost Graph Library to generate a set of potential paths from a
root basic block to the taket basic-block(s).

klee contains the changes to klee. This is mainly a new seracher "GuidedSearcher"
in lib/Core/Sercher.cpp This searcher uses to CallPaths LLVM pass as mentioned
above.
